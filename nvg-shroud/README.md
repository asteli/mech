# NVG Mount Plate

## Haha pretty picture

## Printing this thing
I got good results on a Prusa Mk3. Lay the mount on its side (the skinny and long face) and use supports. I used 0.1mm layer height.
One day I might get around to trying lost PLA aluminum casting. That would be cool. Sigh.

## What is this?
This is an adhesive mounting plate for equipment that mounts to standard FAST/MICH/ACH NVG shrouds. You can print this object and use VHB tape (I recommend using the slightly thicker stuff that gets used to attach GoPro mounts, T=1.6mm).

## Why tho
I was looking for a solution to mounting lights to my MTB helmet that didn't involve fiddly straps, and allowed quick interchange of lights between helmets.

Nitecore make a nice NVG-mount headlamp that throws roughly 1000 lumens at full anger, and I figured I'd work out how to mount it to my Bell Super DH helmet.

All the NVG shrouds I came across either required a 3-hole bolt pattern on the helmet, or had hooks meant to go under the shell of the helmet and a strap that pulled the mount rearward. None of them fit MTB helmets, and I'm not going to drill into mine.

## Errata
The cutout that accepts the lower (sprung) tab on the mounted device may be too narrow for your equipment. It fits just fine with my headlamp but you should make sure it works for your equipment.

## What is the spherical radius of the part of a size L Bell Super DH Helmet that you'd want to adhere a headlamp to?
Wow, I'm glad you asked. It's 150mm, or close enough to 150mm that your adhesive tape will take up the slack.
